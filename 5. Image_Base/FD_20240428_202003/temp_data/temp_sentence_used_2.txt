You Think You Can Hurt Me? You Can
Your Holes Is My Goal
Happiness is Not A Destination It is A Way of Life
take Chances, Make Mistakes, Get Messy
The Revolution Will not be Televised
My Cat and I Talk Shit About You
My dog and I Talk Shit About You
Don't Let The Cat Out
Don't Tell Me What to Do, You're Not My Cat
You Did Not,Wake Up Today to Be a Weak Ass Bitch
You Did Not Wake Up Today to Be Mediocre
Sorry I'm Late I was Pooping
I'm Not Lazy I Just Don't Care
